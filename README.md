# Flutter Issues from Github (A Flutter Demo app)

A new Flutter project for mobile. This app attempts to fetch and show github issues from https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues

## Getting Started

This project was initialized using the skeleton template, and now uses bloc and flutter_bloc for state management.

Please replace the `YOUR_TOKEN_GOES_HERE` with your Github Auth Basic token at https://github.com/KishoreBabuIN/flutterdemo/blob/main/.vscode/launch.json

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Assets

The `assets` directory houses images, fonts, and any other files you want to
include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware
images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware).

## Localization

This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in
the `lib/src/localization` directory.

To support additional languages, please visit the tutorial on
[Internationalizing Flutter
apps](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization)
